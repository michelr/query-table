# query-table

A Claude Code mod that draws query results as aligned, colored tables in the transcript, with the SQL shown above them.

It handles three sources:

- **BigQuery MCP** — results of the `execute_sql` tool from an MCP server named `bigquery`
- **dbt show** — the box table printed by `dbt show` (dbt Fusion)
- **bq CLI** — `bq query` output in the default `pretty` format, or `--format=json` / `prettyjson`

## What it looks like

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ BigQuery · 2 rows · 3 columns                                 │

```

- The query as you wrote it, keeping your line breaks and indentation, colored as SQL
- Numbers right-aligned with thousand separators; negatives in red
- `id`, `*_id`, `*_key` and `*_year` columns keep their digits ungrouped
- Nulls shown as a dim `∅`
- At most 50 rows and 32 characters per cell; columns that don't fit the terminal are counted as hidden

## Requirements

- A Claude Code build with mod support (`claude plugin validate` and `claude plugin test` available)
- For BigQuery tables: an MCP server registered as `bigquery` that exposes `execute_sql`
- For dbt tables: dbt Fusion (the mod recognizes its `dbt-fusion` banner)

## Install

Clone the repo into your mods folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michelr/query-table.git ~/.claude/mods/query-table
```

Claude Code loads mods from `~/.claude/mods` on its own, so start a new session and it's active. Saving a file in the folder reloads the mod when the current turn ends.

### Keeping the clone somewhere else

If you'd rather keep the repo outside `~/.claude/mods`, point Claude Code at it instead. Use one of these, not both, and don't combine them with a copy in the mods folder, or the mod could load twice.

**Every session** — add the folder to `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS` in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS": "~/src/query-table"
  }
}
```

Separate several folders with `:` (`;` on Windows). This setting is read from your user settings only, not from a project's.

**One session** — pass the folder on the command line:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ~/src/query-table
```

## Usage

Nothing to run. Tables appear on their own when:

- the BigQuery `execute_sql` tool returns rows
- a Bash call runs `dbt show` and prints a table
- a Bash call runs `bq query` and prints a table

For `dbt show`, the SQL header appears when the query is passed inline and quoted:

```bash
dbt show --inline "select ... from {{ ref('my_model') }}"
dbt show --inline='select ...'
```

For `bq query`, the SQL header appears when the query is the quoted positional argument (`bq query --nouse_legacy_sql "select ..."`). Piping through `head` is fine; a `tail` that cuts off the column header leaves the output as plain text.

With `--select my_model`, SQL passed as `"$(cat file.sql)"`, or a `bq query` reading from stdin, the usual Bash row stays and the table is drawn below it without a header.

Running and failed calls are drawn by Claude Code as usual.

## Development

```bash
claude plugin validate .
npx -p typescript tsc -p .
claude plugin test .
```

The types the mod compiles against (`.claude-plugin/types/`) are written by Claude Code when it loads the mod and are not checked in. Load the mod once before running `tsc`.

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `hooks/register.tsx` | The render hooks and the table drawing |
| `hooks/parse.ts` | Parsing BigQuery, dbt and bq output, SQL display, number formatting |
| `types/index.d.ts` | The session state the mod keeps (the source and inline SQL of each dbt show / bq query call) |
| `tests/` | Parse tests and render tests |

## Limitations

- dbt show prints a null and the string `"null"` the same way, so both show as `∅`; `bq` does the same with `NULL`
- A dbt query can't start with a `--` comment: dbt reads it as a flag
- dbt core output isn't recognized, only dbt Fusion's
- Queries longer than 10,000 characters are cut at that point
